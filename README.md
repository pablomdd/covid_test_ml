## Description
With this project we do not intend to replace an actual doctor, we are giving the user a suggestion to go to the hospital or to stay at home, based on their symptoms computed trough a trainned Neural Network. 

## About the algorithm
Is a two layer neural network, in the first layer it has 15 neurons with a sigmoid activation function and the second has 1 with a purelin activation function to determine the two possible options. We created 30 test to train the network and with the best Weights and biases we compute the users inputs.
